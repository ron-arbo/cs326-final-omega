## CodeTogether
## Spring 2020  

## Overview:  
Our application is designed to allow people to come together to create and improve upon independent projects in an efficient way. Our site allows users to create an account to showcase their skills and previous experience to others in order to create an effective project team. Similarly, users can create public projects for people to browse. The projects will have all relevant info like a description, necessary skills, github page, etc. This way, users are able to see which project most interests them or fits well with their skillset. This site is not only for programmers, however. People who think that they have “the next big app idea” can come onto the site and create a project in the hopes that some programmers will see it and hop on board. This is what makes our site unique. The combination of programmers and entrepreneurs into one space to discuss and work on projects will facilitate the creation of more applicable and well thought out projects.

## Database Documentation
Our database is a collection containing two types of documents: Projects and Profiles. They are described below 
```Typescript
   project document { 
       _id: <ObjectId>,            //ObjectId provided by MongoDB 
       projectName: String,        //Name of the project 
       projectButtons: String[],   //Array of all languages used to create the project (Ex: ["Java", "HTML", "CSS"]) 
       projectDescription: String, //Description of the project 
       projectLinks: String,       //A string of helpful links related to the project (Githubs, guides, url, etc.) 
       projectNumWorkers: String,  //The number of people you're looking for to help with the project 
       projectProgress: String,    //The amount of progress made on the current project 
       projectWorkers: String,     //The current people working on the project
   }
``` 
 
```Typescript
   profile document { 
       _id: <ObjectId>,           //ObjectId provided by MongoDB 
       profileID: String,         //ID used to identify specific profile 
       firstName: String,         //First name of user 
       lastName: String,          //Last name of user 
       profileAbout: String,      //The 'About' section for the user's profile page

       profileEmail: String,      //The user's email used to sign and log in  
       profileLinks: String,      //The user's links for things like github, linkedin, facebook, etc. 
       profilePassword: String,   //The password used by the user to sign and log in

## Division of Labor
### Milestone 1
index.html - TJ & Aryan  
profile.html - Ron  
create_project.html - Aryan & TJ  
project_description.html - Aryan  
login.html and signup.html - Ron  
extra.html - Aryan  
All CSS files related to these html files were, for the most part, worked on by the same people. Plus, some of the styling was done within the HTML with bootstrap.
### Milestone 2
client.js - See endpoints  
myserver-routing.ts - See endpoints 
Connecting HTML to JS - TJ  
Connecting to Heroku Server - TJ and Ron  
MongoDB Progress - Aryan  

Breakdown of endpoints: (Each endpoint includes client function, server response, html output)  
Project endpoints:  
create - Aryan    
read - Ron  
update - Ron   
delete - Ron  
Profile Endpoints:  
create - TJ  
read - TJ  
update - Ron  
delete - TJ  
Other:  
findAllProjects - Aryan  
### Milestone 3  
Note that we have two methods for the put(), get(), and del() operations. One for projects, and one for profiles. Their implementation is very similar.  
Creation of database and connection in code: Aryan  
put() Method: Mostly Aryan, Small Part Ron  
get() Method: Mostly Ron, Small Part Aryan  
del() Method: Ron  
find() Method: Mostly Aryan, Small Part TJ  
find() Essentially uses get() to retrieve a list of projects in the database to display in our HTML  
Adding radio button selections from HTML into DB entries: TJ  
### Post-Milestone 3
HTML Connection/Output:  
Project CRUD Operations work with DB and Output in HTML:  
Create: Aryan  
Read: Ron  
Update: Ron  
Delete: TJ  
Profile CRUD Operations Work with DB and Output in HTML:  
Create: Aryan  
Read: Ron  
Update: Ron  
Delete: TJ  
  
Other:  
Searching Functionality: Ron  
Minor Index.html layout changes: Ron  
Hyperlink projectName in index.html to appropriate project description: Aryan  
Hyperlink lastName in index.html to appropriate profile page: Ron, but largely based off Aryan's work  
Feedback section: Aryan  
Radio buttons integration into db and HTML: TJ  

## Conclusion
We thoroughly enjoyed the project as a whole, for some of us this was the first time we had done a complete project on our own basically from scratch. Our group didn’t really have any prior knowledge regarding web programming so every step of the way was a learning process. The hardest parts of the project were definitely creating the server and databases, while the easiest parts were HTML and CSS. One thing we wish we had a better understanding of prior to starting the project was the backend portion of the project, we relied a lot on stack overflow to answer questions we had. One decently sized technical hurdle was connecting Heroku to our project which took some time to figure out what we needed to do.
